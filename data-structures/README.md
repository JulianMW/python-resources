# Implementing Various Data-Structures in Python

## Stack
(LIFO - Last In First Out)

## Queue
(FIFO - First In First Out)

## Deque
(Add/remove items from either side)

## Unordered List Abstract
(aka a 'Linked' list. Each item points to the next. Only need to know where the 'head', or first item, is)

## Ordered List Abstract
(each item holds a relative position that is based upon some underlying characteristic of the item)

## BST
A searchable binary tree. Nodes contain a key, which is used to place them in the tree, and a payload, which is the data they posess.
### BST traversals (left-to-right, etc.)

## Heap
a simple tree-like structure. It is like a binary tree, but with no payload. It can be stored as a list. Index starts from 1. Parent nodes are at i//2, left child at i*2, right child at i*2 + 1. Follows a simple ordering like min or max, such that the min or max value is always at the top of the heap.

ex. Min-Heap rule: Every item is larger than its parent
