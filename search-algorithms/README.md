# A library of searching algorithms
include: big-O (min, average, max), resources/memory needed, data format requirements (ex. sorted, integer etc...)

## List Search Algorithms
### Sequential Search
Loop through entire sequence. Performance:
| Best | Worst | Average |
| ---- | ----- | ------- |
| O(1) | O(n) | O(n/2) |


### Binary Search

Loop through entire sequence. Performance:
| Best | Worst | Average |
| ---- | ----- | ------- |
| O(1) | O(log n) | ? |


## Searchable Structures

### Binary Search
##### Data requirements:
Sorted
